> [!WARNING]
> Why I'm not working on them right now?
> 
> Bcoz I'm immediately looking for a job, and don't want to get involved in things that won't help me in landing a job that I want (compilers and Deep Learning).

## BookView

- a simple static-site generator that parses markdown, and generates html. But, html strictly outputs `like a typical book`. The closest one is `rust mdbook`, but, better.
- Recently microsoft released [pdf to markdown python app](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown). Not played with it much, but we can parse free pdf books and generate beautiful book websites for people to read.

## Go-fsspec

- it's been waiting for too long to be completed, but still not in the priority list.
- [github link](https://github.com/deependujha/go-fsspec)

## caddy in zig

- zig is a beautiful language if you're drunk enough.
- building a [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) like server from scratch in zig will be awesome.

## nccl function implementation in go

- implement `all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, point-to-point send and receive` in go and zig.
