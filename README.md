## BookView

- a simple static-site generator that parses markdown, and generates html. But, html strictly outputs `like a typical book`. The closest one is `rust mdbook`, but, better.
- Recently microsoft released [pdf to markdown python app](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown). Not played with it much, but we can parse free pdf books and generate beautiful book websites for people to read.

## Go-fsspec

- it's been waiting for too long to be completed, but still not in the priority list.
- [github link](https://github.com/deependujha/go-fsspec)
